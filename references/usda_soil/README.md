## USDA Soil Report Resources

I generated a soil report from the USDA at their web soil survey (https://websoilsurvey.nrcs.usda.gov/app/). I used "***CO645** - Arapaho-Roosevelt National Forest Area, Parts of Boulder, Clear Creek Gilpin, Grand, Park, and Larimer Counties - USFS*" as the Area of Interest (AOI). I honestly don't know how helpful it's going to be. It's pretty dense. At least it has a halfway **decent Glossary**.

I also found this National Soil Survey Handbook, which might be useful in demystifying some of the soil codes (https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/soils/scientists/?cid=nrcs142p2_054242)

Soil Taxonomy Link (https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/soils/home/?cid=nrcs142p2_053577) These are also pretty long and horrible. 

Okay, I'm closing in. **This looks like the stuff we want!** (https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/soils/survey/class/data/?cid=nrcs142p2_053583). **We want series name**. It looks like the other info on the soil might just be extra information that will potentially obscure it. I'll do some EDA to determine frequency that different classifications show up. BUT, I think that "Leighcan" etc. might be the only imporatnt part and the other stuff might just be fluff.

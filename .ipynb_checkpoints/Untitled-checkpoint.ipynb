    "The study area includes four wilderness areas located in the Roosevelt National Forest of northern Colorado. Each observation is a 30m x 30m patch. You are asked to predict an integer classification for the forest cover type. The seven types are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1 - Spruce/Fir\n",
    "2 - Lodgepole Pine\n",
    "3 - Ponderosa Pine\n",
    "4 - Cottonwood/Willow\n",
    "5 - Aspen\n",
    "6 - Douglas-fir\n",
    "7 - Krummholz\n",
    "\n",
    "The training set (15120 observations) contains both features and the Cover_Type. The test set contains only the features. You must predict the Cover_Type for every row in the test set (565892 observations).\n",
